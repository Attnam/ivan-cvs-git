1. Description

Iter Vehemens ad Necem (IVAN) is a graphical roguelike game,
which currently runs in Windows, DOS and Linux. Its most
innovative parts at the moment are its material handling
system and its lighting system.

-----------------------------

2. System requirements

The game *works* on quite slow systems, but we recommend that
use at least a:

	Pentium 233 MHz
	48 Megs of RAM

	Windows 9x/ME/XP/2000 (at least)
	DirectX 8

	or:

	DOS
	Vesa 2.0 compatible video card

	or:
	
	Linux with 
	(SDL library version 1.0.0 or higher)

-----------------------------

3. General gameplay

IVAN works pretty much in the same way as other roguelikes 
(Nethack, Adom, Slash'em etc...). The player controls a 
character. The player moves from the direction keys.
All other commands can be found by pressing ?-key in the
game.

Genie

	The sprit that lives in a bottle. When freed grants a wish. When the Genie becomes hostile it makes a wish and wishes for a plate mail.

Mammoth
	
	Pretty normal creatures except that when they die an ivory horn. 

Gremlin
	
	These creatures multiply when they touch water and die when see bright lights.

Dwarf

	Dwarfs are a pretty generic character. Except that they carry pick-axes and dig through walls. They should also have more mithril and other precious metals than normal monsters. You should also be able to bribe them to your side with gold.


Hobbit

	A Tolkien cliche, but don't mind about that. Maybe these creatures could carry more rings (especially rings of invisiblity)

Gnome

Floating eye (or Beholder)

	 When you hit this monster you will fall asleep (a la Nethack)

Titan
Giant

Scorpion

	Poisons.

Lich
	Preferably like in BG2.

Cyclops
Vampire
	
	Should be damaged by too much light.

Minotaur

Kerberus

	Bites with three heads.

Light Bugs (work in progress-name)
      
	These creatures normally are drawn towards light sources.

Dark Bugs (work in progress-name)
     
	These creatures normally are drawn towards darkness.

Necromancer

	Should raise corpses as skeletons and zombies.

Mutant tentacle

	Purple skin. Low agility, but very high intelligence. Can use humanoid weapons.

unnamed (maybe xorn or ghost)
	
	Can go through walls

Huge firefly
     
	Flying. Emits light (might be a useful pet)

Shaman

	Curses at you and so lowers the echantment level of a randomly picked item in your equipment or stack.

Monkey
	(a la Nethack) Fights a short time and then steals one of your items and then tries to run away.

Eddies in space-time continuum

       These horrible "creatures" teleport the player randomly around and sometimes create weird couches. 

Mutated giant mushroom
	
	Most of the time stand idle and sometimes teleport from place to place. Sometimes shoot spores at player. Sometimes the spores could grow to be mushrooms. (not too often though, so the level wouldn't be filled with mushrooms.)

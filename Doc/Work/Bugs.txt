(s) It is impossible to polymorph into a kamikaze dwarf, the game just says "Be more precise" since there are many configurations with same name. (low priority)

//Polymorphed into a mistress warlady and wielding the Justifier, I attacked Attnam. After killing a dozen citizens inside
  and outside the Cathedral, I noticed odd lagging, activated the see whole map cheat and discovered Petrus had gone mad
  and was killing everyone. I suppose some item kicked by guard hit him and he thought Attnam's folk had started a rebellion?
  A funny side note: a kamikaze dwarf had just blown up his wives, which would perhaps be a humane reason for his actions :)
//Lanterns put inside itemcontainers still emit light.
//Digging book shelves probably doesn't work correctly.

Offering chests in prohibited. (They are too important according to the game)
Skeletons can be poisoned.
//Spiders can lock doors.
If multiple chests are stacked, only the top one can be opened with key.
Odd monsters seem to be able to apply.
Dipping to corpses doesn't work.
(this may not be a bug, but it is a problem) Go and heal commands might be too fast on a very fast machine (> 1 GHz or something like that)
Does using a two-handed weapon yield exp to only one arm?


Game always crashes when one door is kicked with this trace.

(notice there isn't a boobytrap on the door)
